# PostgreSQL hit ratio

## Buffer cache hit ratio

```sql                                                                                                    ...
SELECT 
  sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
  sum(heap_blks_hit)  as heap_hit,
  sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio                           
FROM 
  pg_statio_user_tables;
```

## Index cache hit ratio

```sql
SELECT 
  sum(idx_blks_read) as idx_read,
  sum(idx_blks_hit)  as idx_hit,
  (sum(idx_blks_hit) - sum(idx_blks_read)) / sum(idx_blks_hit) as ratio
FROM 
  pg_statio_user_indexes;
